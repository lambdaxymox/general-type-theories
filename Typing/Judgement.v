(** Whenever an object appears in the boundary of an object judgement, then its

    NOTE. This is a special case of [boundary_slot_from_presupposition] below.
    It is abstracted out because it’s used twice: directly for object
    judgements, and as part of the case for equality judgements.

    In fact it’s almost trivial, so could easily be inlined; but conceptually
    it is the same thing both times, and in type theory with more judgements,
